A social impact application, where local businesses (i.e. supermarkets, restaurants, etc) can post food or beverages that are still good for consumption, and that would otherwise be thrown out. Those is the local community who need it can then find these places and pick up the items. As a result, FoodCycle provides a green solution to reducing food waste while helping those in need within the local community.
